Artemis Financial was a financial company who required high security standards for their products. Their base code had security vulnerabilities and it was my job to make the code more secure and fix the vulnerabilities. I used Maven to find the security vulnerabilities and solve the issues. Secure code is vital to the company because it prevents them and their customers from being targeted for security attacks. Maven was extremely helpful in addressing and finding the security vulnerabilites. You can increase security by using algorithm cyphers such as AES for secure encryption. After refactoring the code I made sure it was secure by using Maven to check for security vulnerabilities. Maven will be extremely helpful in future assignments. I would show future employers this assignment and show them where I suppressed the security vulnerabilities.
